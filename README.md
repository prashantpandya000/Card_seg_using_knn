# Card_seg_using_knn
 
 Problem Statement 1
 
Overview: This case requires you to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy.
The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. 
The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Expectations from the candidate:
•	Advanced data preparation: Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving “intelligent” KPIs such as:

o	Monthly average purchase and cash advance amount

o	Purchases by type (one-off, installments)

o	Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,

o	Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),

o	Payments to minimum payments ratio etc (think of more types of similar analysis)

•	Advanced reporting: Use the derived KPIs to gain insight on the customer profiles.

•	Identification of the relationships/ affinities between services.

•	Clustering: Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioral segments of credit card holders

•	Identify cluster characteristics of the cluster using detailed profiling.

•	Provide the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for given set of cluster characteristics
